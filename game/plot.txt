Your smoking hot girlfriend was taken by the evil wizard, Doodldorf. He's locked her high atop his
tower thinking nobody could reach her. Little does Doodldorf know that our protagonist of the story is
the prince of jumps, err Jump Prince.. uh, maybe Regal Jumper? There's a catchy name in there somewhere,
but I can't think of it right now. Let's just say he's really good at jumping. A king at it some might
say.
The longer our hero charges his jumps, the farther he will go. Additionally he's able to rebound off
walls, allowing him to reach platforms that are seemingly impossible to get to.
Be wary, though. One misstep, one wrong jump, can have you plummeting far below. I mean, it won't kill
you, but that's still got to suck losing all that progress, right?
Doodldorf's minions are also patrolling the tower. Some will just bounce you around, but Spike Bug has
quite the sharp exterior which may be rather unpleasant.

Jump your way to the top and save the Tower Babe!
